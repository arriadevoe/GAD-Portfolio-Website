# Guillermo Arria-Devoe - Portfolio
In-progress portfolio project.

Actively seeking full-time opportunities in full-stack development. I am proficient with HTML, CSS, LESS/SASS pre-processing, JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS Express servers, SQLite databases created with KnexJS, and always eager to learn how to leverage new technology.

I am also currently studying data science part-time with Lambda School.

My background before web development starts with an undergraduate education in environmental engineering and ends with four years of dedicated habitat restoration in South Florida.

I love to travel, camp, read, hike, surf, and forge friendships on the road.

Open to relocation. Ideally Utah but will consider Colorado, Oregon, Washington, California, Nevada, or Arizona.
