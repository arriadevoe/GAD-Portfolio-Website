A progressive web application featuring my work and who I am. Designed and coded by yours truly using Gatsby, React, SCSS, GraphQL, and Contentful for content delivery.

Feel free to use this project for your own website. Getting started is easy.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Add Contentful environment variables**

    Create a [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) account if you don't have one, then create an .env file in the main directory with the following two variables.

    ```sh
    CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=xz7BD_x3-0abv-cilmaq0c2fFHblKrZZXaha5k6QM
    CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=k10e2ml19krm8
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up. Replace GraphQL queries where necessary.

    ```sh
    cd my-portfolio/
    gatsby develop
    ```
